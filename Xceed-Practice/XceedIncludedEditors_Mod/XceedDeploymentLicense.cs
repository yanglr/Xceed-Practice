       * How to license Xceed components 
       * ================================
       *
       * To license (unlock) your component, set the LicenseKey property with your 
       * license key in the entry point of the application. This will ensure the component
       * is licensed before any of its methods are called.
       *  
       * If the component is used in a DLL project (no entry point is available), it is 
       * recommended that the LicenseKey property be set in a static constructor of a 
       * class that will be accessed systematically before any component is instantiated,
       * or you can simply set the LicenseKey property immediately BEFORE 
       * instantiation of the component. 
       * 
       * To deploy this sample, your license key should be set in the OnStartup() method.
       *
       * For more information, consult the "Licensing" topics in the product documentation. 
       *
       * Xceed DataGrid for WPF can be unlocked with either a license key 
       * that starts with the letters "DGF", "TDV" or "DGP".
